# WOW Repairs by Auto Squad
Authors: [Alliyah Munir](https://github.com/AlliyahMunir) &  [Michael Vong](https://github.com/michaelvong)

## Project Description
WOW Repairs is an auto repair shop designed to provide quick and effective service. With AutoSquad on the job, helping customers until they are satisfied will not be a problem! 

## Our Purpose
We believe that creating a repair shop program with a variety of services that can be addressed through an input/output interface can make it easier for customers to receive assistance. Furthermore, incorporating multiple design patterns to create a repair shop seems like an intriguing and fun process for the AutoSquad! 

## Implemented Techonology
The languages/tools/technology we plan on using include the language of C++ programming as the chosen language and github as a tool, with the technology being the use of a terminal such as Putty. 

## Project Outcome
The input/output of our project will begin with a menu board of pricing, services, and store hours, followed by IO Interface with customers allowing them to input which service(s) they would like to receive. Afterwards, the customer will be asked about car details, given a wait time and total cost overview. Once the AutoSquad has completed all repairs, the customer will be able to pay, and receive a receipt, in person. 

## Design Pattern Choices
The two design patterns our team will be using is the Composite and Strategy patterns.

Michael: My design pattern will be the Composite pattern. I plan to create a Main Menu that will be executed as soon as Customers enter the shop. Using the Main Menu, customers can select a category, depending on their needs. These categories include Checkout, Reading/Writing Reviews, Current Deals, etc.. With this pattern, users can easily access the category they desire in efficient time. 

Alliyah: The design pattern I chose is the Strategy Pattern. I chose this pattern because it allows one to encapusulate a family of algorithms, allowing the developer to place each in the appropriate StrategyBehavior. This way, when implementing user interface, customers are able to see view our products along with the implented Stategy Behaviors such as quantity, rating, etc.. I will use the Strategy Pattern to create a list of Products that contain various categories, allowing a user to view the product, price, rating, and quantity simultaneously.

 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in with the TA (during lab hours or office hours). Your entire team must be present. 
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II
 > * In the meeting with your TA you will discuss: 
 >   - How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 >   - Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 >   - Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 >   - What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Kanban board. 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
